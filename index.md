<h2 align="center">Spring 2020 Updated Online Syllabus</h2>
<h3 align="center">Mondays & Wednesdays <b>Online</b></h3>
<br>
<h4 align="center"><b>**Thanks for a great semester everyone!**</b></h4>

<hr>
After the extended Spring Break, Ling001 will be moving fully online.

**What will stay the same?** 
> You'll access course materials in exactly the same way you did before. Lectures will be live-streamed and [posted here](https://upenn.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Sessions/List.aspx?folderID=99e28b4b-8d65-4ac1-9fe4-ab3c00e43bf5) at our usual class time for you to watch and links to all class materials (readings, study guides, and practice problems/solutions) will be right here on the website, as before.

**What will change?**
> The remaining two exams will now be take-home (see [schedule](#schedule)). Recitations and office hours will become a live video chat via Zoom (so those in other time zones can catch up with what they missed later). Finally, your instructors will be available via video chat for individual appointments. Specific changes are indicated on the syllabus below. 

**What new tools will I need?**
> (1) Lectures will be posted on [Panopto](https://upenn.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Sessions/List.aspx?folderID=99e28b4b-8d65-4ac1-9fe4-ab3c00e43bf5) as usual, but I'll also send a link just before class to the live stream so you can watch (and comment) live if you want to.
> (2) Discussion will take place on [Piazza](https://piazza.com/upenn/spring2020/ling001/home) and office hours and recitation on Zoom!

**Stay safe, everyone!**

## How to do well in LING 1
- ~~Come to class~~ Watch the videos and do the assigned readings
- Attempt the practice problems and check your answers against the solutions
- Come prepared to recitation (on Piazza). Ask questions about the course material and for help on practice problems you had trouble with 

## Policies
- **Attendance**: There is no formal attendance policy, but attendance is highly correlated with class performance.
- **Rescheduling or make-up exams**: Because we drop your lowest exam, we do not offer retakes or make-up exams. But please contact us if something extreme happens - a family or medical emergency, for example - and we can discuss some options provided you have documentation. Note that we do not consider multiple exams on the same day an extreme happening. 
- **Late assignments**: Late language journals will be accepted ~~with a 2% point per day late penalty~~ without penalty through the end of the semester.
- **Re-grade requests**: If you notice a grading error, we'd be happy to look at your exam again. To request a re-grade, please fill out the re-grade request form via canvas *within one week of receiving your graded exam or assignment*. This class is really big, so we need a way to formally keep track of these things. If you ask about grading in person or via email, you'll be directed to make a formal request via the regrade request form. 
- **Accommodations and non-discrimination**: We are happy to provide accommodations to anyone with documentation from Student Disability Services and to make alternate arrangements when class conflicts with a religious holiday. Please notify your recitation section TA as soon as possible to make these arrangements.
- **Academic Integrity**: We will follow the rules of the University and the [Code of Academic Integrity](https://catalog.upenn.edu/pennbook/code-of-academic-integrity/).  It is your responsibility to be familiar with these policies.
- **Support**: Asking for help is a sign of strength! We hope you'll reach out to us if you need help. We also want you to be aware of Penn's [Academic](https://www.college.upenn.edu/index.php/support) & [Wellness Resources](https://www.wellnessatpenn.com/)

## FAQs
*Updated March 19, 2020 to reflect the new online version of the course* 

**Can I skip the fourth exam if I am happy with my grade on the first three?**
> Yes! You can skip the fourth exam and it will be dropped. Your grade will be based on the first three exams.

**If I miss recitation can I come to another recitation section that week?**
> Yes, you can join any live recitation discussion on Piazza that works for your schedule.~~but the rooms are small so it's best to email the section TA to let them know.~~

**I noticed a mistake in the grading of my exam. How do I get this fixed?**
> We will look at your exam again if you make a formal [re-grade request](https://canvas.upenn.edu/courses/1489351/modules/items/17298855) via Canvas within one week of getting your exam back.

**I missed or failed an exam. What can I do to make it up?**
> Nothing. We don't allow make-up exams or retakes. However, we drop your lowest exam score, so you can still do well in the class. Just make sure it doesn't happen more than once! 

**Can I turn in my language journal late?** 
> Language journals will be accepted without penalty through the end of the semester (April 29th). ~~Yes, but there is a 2% point per day late penalty.~~

**I participated in an experiment (or attended a talk). When will I get my bonus points?**
> To receive bonus points, you must (1) make a [bonus points declaration](https://canvas.upenn.edu/courses/1489351/quizzes/2285014?module_item_id=17260181) on Canvas and (2) write about your research experience in your [language journal](resources/language-journal-assignment). Your bonus points will be awarded as soon as you make your declaration, but we will check your journal (and SONA records, if you participated in an experiment) to confirm these points at the end of the semester.

**What does it mean to be "engaged" on perusall?**
> Read more about how engagement is computed on perusall [here](resources/how-perusall-works.pdf) and see a sample [here](https://perusall.com/downloads/scoring-examples.pdf).

**How do I watch the lecture live?**
> I'll send a link just before our usual class time (12pm M & W) via Piazza for those who want to watch the lecture live. You'll click the link to watch and can login with your PennKey if you'd like to make live comments to me. I'll pause periodically to answer questions I see.

**I'm in a different time zone, will I miss anything?**
> No, definitely not! The lectures will be recorded so you can watch them any time you like. All discussions will take place on Piazza, so you read through the discussions any time, and also add your own comments and questions whenever you can.

**I'm worried about how I will do this. I have like 9 people working from home in my house, plus 3 toddlers, 2 birds, and a dog. Help!**
> Don't worry, we were thinking of you when we redesigned the course. We ramped things way down, extended the language journal deadline, and are giving you a full week to complete the (now take-home) exams. Each week, we will give you a specific goal so you know exactly what you need to do to be able to do the exams. We know this is not easy for you and we are here to help.
