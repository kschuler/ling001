## Overview

### Description
A general introduction to the nature, history and use of human language, speech and writing. Topics include the biological basis of human language, and analogous systems in other creatures; relations to cognition, communication, and social organization; sounds, forms and meanings in the world's languages; the reconstruction of linguistic history and the family tree of languages; dialect variation and language standardization; language and gender; language learning by children and adults; the neurology of language and language disorders; the nature and history of writing systems. Intended for any undergraduate interested in language or its use, this course is also recommended as an introduction for students who plan to major in linguistics.

## How to do well in LING 1
- Come to class and do the assigned readings
- Attempt the practice problems and check your answers against the solutions
- Come prepared to recitation. Ask questions about the course material and for help on practice problems you had trouble with 

## Policies
- **Attendance**: There is no formal attendance policy, but attendance is highly correlated with class performance.
- **Rescheduling or make-up exams**: Because we drop your lowest exam, we do not offer retakes or make-up exams. But please contact us if something extreme happens - a family or medical emergency, for example - and we can discuss some options provided you have documentation. Note that we do not consider multiple exams on the same day an extreme happening. 
- **Late assignments**: Late language journals will be accepted with a 2% point per day late penalty.
- **Re-grade requests**: If you notice a grading error, we'd be happy to look at your exam again. To request a re-grade, please fill out the re-grade request form via canvas *within one week of receiving your graded exam or assignment*. This class is really big, so we need a way to formally keep track of these things. If you ask about grading in person or via email, you'll be directed to make a formal request via the regrade request form. 
- **Accommodations and non-discrimination**: We are happy to provide accommodations to anyone with documentation from Student Disability Services and to make alternate arrangements when class conflicts with a religious holiday. Please notify your recitation section TA as soon as possible to make these arrangements.
- **Academic Integrity**: We will follow the rules of the University and the [Code of Academic Integrity](https://catalog.upenn.edu/pennbook/code-of-academic-integrity/).  It is your responsibility to be familiar with these policies.
- **Support**: Asking for help is a sign of strength! We hope you'll reach out to us if you need help. We also want you to be aware of Penn's [Academic](https://www.college.upenn.edu/index.php/support) & [Wellness Resources](https://www.wellnessatpenn.com/)

## FAQs
**Can I skip the fourth exam if I am happy with my grade on the first three?**
> Yes! You can skip the fourth exam and it will be dropped. Your grade will be based on the first three exams.

**If I miss recitation can I come to another recitation section that week?**
> Yes, but the rooms are small so it's best to email the section TA to let them know.

**I noticed a mistake in the grading of my exam. How do I get this fixed?**
> We will look at your exam again if you make a formal re-grade request via Canvas within one week of getting your exam back.

**I missed or failed an exam. What can I do to make it up?**
> Nothing. We don't allow make-up exams or retakes. However, we drop your lowest exam score, so you can still do well in the class. Just make sure it doesn't happen more than once! 

**Can I turn in my language journal late?** 
> Yes, but there is a 2% point per day late penalty. 

**I participated in an experiment (or attended a talk). When will I get my bonus points?**
> To receive bonus points, you must (1) make a bonus points declaration on Canvas and (2) write about your research experience in your language journal. Your bonus points will be awarded as soon as you make your declaration, but we will check your journal (and SONA records, if you participated in an experiment) to confirm these points at the end of the semester.
