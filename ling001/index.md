## Course description

### Overview
In this seminar, we'll read and discuss classic and contemporary theories of the language acquisition process.  Topics include: prosodic, semantic, and syntactic bootstrapping theories, usage-based approaches, formal generative approaches, neural network models and more.  Each week we'll read a paper outlining a theoretical approach paired with either (1) an empirical investigation of the approach, (2) a paper expressing opposition to the approach, or (3) both. We'll discuss the strengths and weakness of both the theories and the empirical studies that investigate them. We'll also consider how one might design future experiments to test these theories.

### Evaluation

### Discussion question instructions

* Please post 5-8 discussion questions on [Canvas](https://canvas.upenn.edu/) by midnight on Monday before class. Your questions should reflect your understanding and thoughts on the assigned readings and will serve as the basis for our in-class discussion. These posting are meant to be very informal â€“ a simple list of questions will suffice, but a narrative style is fine, too, if you prefer that.  There are no formatting restrictions.

### Research proposal instructions

* [Research proposal](spring2019/research-proposal.html)
* [In-class peer review](spring2019/research-proposal.html#in-class-peer-review)
