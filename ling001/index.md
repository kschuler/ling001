## Policies

## Resources
Grading (50 points total):
• 5 points for each relevant observation (20 max).
• Up to 30 points for insightfulness, creativity, and/or originality and for linking your observations with class lectures and/or readings. Assume that the reader has the class knowledge – that is, do not explain class materials. Best strategy: start early!

### Discussion question instructions

* Please post 5-8 discussion questions on [Canvas](https://canvas.upenn.edu/) by midnight on Monday before class. Your questions should reflect your understanding and thoughts on the assigned readings and will serve as the basis for our in-class discussion. These posting are meant to be very informal – a simple list of questions will suffice, but a narrative style is fine, too, if you prefer that.  There are no formatting restrictions.

### Research proposal instructions

* [Research proposal](spring2019/research-proposal.html)
* [In-class peer review](spring2019/research-proposal.html#in-class-peer-review)
* [Written response to reviews](spring2019/research-proposal.html#written-response-to-reviews)
