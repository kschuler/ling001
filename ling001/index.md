## How to do well
- Come to class and do the assigned readings
- Attempt the practice problems and check your answers against the solutions
- Come prepared to recitation. Ask questions about the course material and for help on practice problems you had trouble with

## Resources
### Exams
Exams will test understanding of concepts discussed in lectures and readings. You will be provided with a study guide, practice questions, and solutions to the practice questions for each exam. Exam questions will closely mirror practice questions. 

### Linguistics journal
Grading (50 points total):
• 5 points for each relevant observation (20 max).
• Up to 30 points for insightfulness, creativity, and/or originality and for linking your observations with class lectures and/or readings. Assume that the reader has the class knowledge – that is, do not explain class materials. Best strategy: start early!

## Policies
- **Attendance**: There is no formal attendance policy, but attendance is highly correlated with class performance.
- **Make-up exams**: Only students with a documented family or medical emergancy will be granted the opportunity to make-up an exam. Email your recitation section TA to make these arrangments.
- **Rescheduling exams**: Only students with a religious conflict or an official university event may reschedule an exam. In these cases, students must provide documentation and *advanced notice*, so email your recitation section TA as soon as possible. Note that multiple exams on the same day is not a valid reason to reschedule. 
- **Re-grade requests**: If you feel a grading error has been made, you must make a formal regrade request via canvas. TAs are not allowed to discuss regrading with you until you have made a formal written request. If you ask about re-grading in person or via email, you'll be directed to make a formal request via canvas.
- **Accommodations and non-discrimination**: We are happy to provide accommodations to anyone with documentation from Student Disability Services and to make alternate arrangements when class conflicts with a religious holiday. Please notify your recitation section TA as soon as possible to make these arrangements.
- **Academic Integrity**: We will follow the rules of the University and the [Code of Academic Integrity](https://catalog.upenn.edu/pennbook/code-of-academic-integrity/).  It is your responsibility to be familiar with these policies.



## FAQs
**If I am happy with my grade on the first three exams, do I have to take the fourth?**
> Nope! You can skip the fourth exam and it will be dropped. Your grade will be based on the first three exams.

**If I miss my recitation, can I come to another section that week?**
> Yes, but the rooms are small so it's best to email the section TA to let them know.

**I think you made a mistake grading my exam, what should I do?**
> We will regrade your exam if you make a formal regrade request via canvas (see regrading policy above).
