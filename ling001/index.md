## How to do well
- Come to class and do the assigned readings
- Attempt the practice problems and check your answers against the solutions
- Come prepared to recitation. Ask questions about the course material and for help on practice problems you had trouble with

## Resources
### Exams
There are four exams worth 150 points each, but the lowest exam score is dropped. There is no final exam. Exams will test understanding of concepts discussed in lectures and readings. You will be provided with a study guide, practice questions, and solutions to the practice questions for each exam. Exam questions will closely resemble practice questions. 

### Language journal
Grading (50 points total):
• 5 points for each relevant observation (20 max).
• Up to 30 points for insightfulness, creativity, and/or originality and for linking your observations with class lectures and/or readings. Assume that the reader has the class knowledge – that is, do not explain class materials. Best strategy: start early!

## Policies
- **Attendance**: There is no formal attendance policy, but attendance is highly correlated with class performance.
- **Make-up exams**: Only students with a documented family or medical emergancy will be granted the opportunity to make-up an exam. Email your recitation section TA to make these arrangments.
- **Rescheduling exams**: Only students with a religious conflict or an official university event may reschedule an exam. In these cases, students must provide documentation and *advanced notice*, so email your recitation section TA as soon as possible. Note that multiple exams on the same day is not a valid reason to reschedule. 
- **Late assignments**: Late language journals will be accepted with a 5 point per day late penalty.
- **Re-grade requests**: If you feel a grading error has been made, you must make a formal regrade request via canvas *within one week of receiving your graded exam or assignment*. TAs are not allowed to discuss regrading with you until you have made a formal written request. If you ask about regrading in person or via email, you'll be directed to make a formal request via canvas.
- **Accommodations and non-discrimination**: We are happy to provide accommodations to anyone with documentation from Student Disability Services and to make alternate arrangements when class conflicts with a religious holiday. Please notify your recitation section TA as soon as possible to make these arrangements.
- **Academic Integrity**: We will follow the rules of the University and the [Code of Academic Integrity](https://catalog.upenn.edu/pennbook/code-of-academic-integrity/).  It is your responsibility to be familiar with these policies.



## FAQs
**If I am happy with my grade on the first three exams, do I have to take the fourth?**
> Nope! You can skip the fourth exam and it will be dropped. Your grade will be based on the first three exams.

**If I miss my recitation, can I come to another section that week?**
> Yes, but the rooms are small so it's best to email the section TA to let them know.

**I think you made a mistake grading my exam, what should I do?**
> We will regrade your exam if you make a formal regrade request via canvas by the deadline (see regrading policy above).

**What if I miss or fail an exam?**
> We drop your lowest exam score, so this is no problem. Just make sure it doesn't happen more than once! 

**Can I turn in my language journal late?** 
> Yes, but there is a 5 point per day late penalty.
